# CNN-keras-cat-vs-dog
Image classification

In this project I used Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN) to solve binary image classification of cats and dogs.

Libraries used in this project:
- Tensorflow
- numpy
- openCV
- matplotlib

Project stages:
- Import data ( download data from : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765 )
- Prepare data by reshape them and save as pickle
- Split data for training and testing
- Build CNN sequential model 
- Train ,test and evaluate model
- Plot model accuracy chart
- Practical use
