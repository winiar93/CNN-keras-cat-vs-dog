# CNN-keras-cat-vs-dog
Image classification

In this project I used Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN) to solve binary image classification of cats and dogs.

Libraries used in this project:
- Tensorflow
- numpy
- openCV
- matplotlib

project stages:
- Import data
- Prepare data
- Split data for training and testing
- Build CNN model
- Test and evaluate model
- Practical use
